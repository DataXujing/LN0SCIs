Description: Construct the simultaneous confidence intervals for
             ratios of means of Log-normal populations with excess zeros. It also has a Python module that do the same thing,
             and can be applied to multiple comparisons of parameters of any k mixture distributions. And we provide four methods,
             the method based on generalized pivotal quantity with order statistics and the quantity based on Wilson by Li et al. (2009) <doi:10.1016/j.spl.2009.03.004> (FGW), and the methods based on 
             generalized pivotal quantity with order statistics and the quantity based on Hannig (2009) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asp050> (FGH). The other two methods are 
             based on two-step MOVER intervals by Amany H, Abdel K (2015) <doi:10.1080/03610918.2013.767911>. We deduce Fiducial generalized pivotal two-step MOVER intervals based on 
             Wilson quantity (MOVERW) and based on Hannig's quantity (MOVERH). All these approach you can find in the paper of us which it has been submitted.
